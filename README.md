### How the game works
  The game begins with a white sphere in the center of the screen. Bacteria grows around the sphere. The goal of the game is destroying all bacteria before the bacteria reach a specified size. If bacteria reach this specified size before being destroyed, the player loses a life. The player has two life’s before losing. To win the player must destroy all bacteria without losing both life’s. The player gains points through killing bacteria the smaller the bacteria is when destroyed the more points the user gets for destroying it.
 
### Instructions

Right click and move the mouse to rotate the sphere.
